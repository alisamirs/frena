# Frena Enhancements Documentation

This document outlines all the enhancements made to the Frena (Forex Arena) project to transform it from a basic MVP into a feature-rich currency conversion application.

## Overview

The enhancements focus on improving user experience, and creating a more polished, production-ready application.

## Major Enhancements

3. Currency moves to the top of the list
4. Preference is saved locally
5. User can filter to show only favorites using the chip button

### 2. Search Functionality üîç

### 8. Smart Sorting Algorithm üìä

**Problem Solved:** Users wanted their most relevant currencies at the top.

**Implementation:**
- Three-tier sorting system:
  1. **Favorites** - Always appear first
  2. **Popular Currencies** - Common currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, etc.)
  3. **Alphabetical** - All others sorted by code

**Logic:**
```dart
// Favorites first
if (aIsFavorite && !bIsFavorite) return -1;
if (!aIsFavorite && bIsFavorite) return 1;

// Then popular currencies
if (aIsPopular && !bIsPopular) return -1;
if (!aIsPopular && bIsPopular) return 1;

// Finally alphabetical
return a.key.compareTo(b.key);
```

- Visual error indicators (icons, colors)
- Retry mechanisms
- Graceful degradation to offline mode
- User-friendly language

**Error Scenarios Handled:**

## Technical Architecture

### File Structure
```
lib/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.dart                   # Entry point, main list screen
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ converter_screen.dart       # Enhanced converter UI
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ settings_screen.dart        # New settings interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api_service.dart           # API communication (unchanged)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ database_helper.dart       # SQLite caching (unchanged)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ currency_data.dart         # New currency information utilities
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ preferences_service.dart   # New user preferences management
```

### Dependencies Added
```yaml
shared_preferences: ^2.2.2  # User preferences persistence
flutter_svg: ^2.0.10        # SVG support for future use
```

### State Management
- Continues to use `setState()` for simplicity
- State is well-organized within each screen
- Preferences loaded on app init
- Efficient state updates (only what's needed)

## User Journey Examples

### Scenario 1: First Time User
1. App launches with USD as default base currency
2. Sees currency list with popular currencies near top
3. Searches for home currency using search field
4. Opens settings and selects home currency
5. Returns to list, sees rates in chosen currency
6. Stars 3-4 frequently used currencies
7. Opens converter and performs first conversion

### Scenario 2: Frequent Traveler
1. Opens app (base currency already set to EUR)
2. Favorites filter already enabled (from last session)
3. Sees only USD, GBP, JPY, CHF (starred currencies)
4. Quickly checks current rates
5. Taps floating action button
6. Converter opens with EUR pre-selected
7. Types amount, sees instant conversion
8. Copies result to clipboard for expense tracking

### Scenario 3: Offline User
1. User opens app on airplane
2. App detects no connectivity
3. Orange banner shows "Showing offline data"
4. Timestamp shows "Last updated 2h ago"
5. All functionality works normally with cached data
6. User can still search, filter, convert
7. Upon landing, user taps refresh
8. Data updates, offline banner disappears

## Performance Metrics
